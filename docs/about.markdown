Hi! 

My names is Luke and I am a software engineer with 15+ years of experience in IT.
I decided to create this web page to share my insight into programming. 
I do realize that there are hundreds of pages like this on the Internet and I will not argue that mine is the best...
simply, because this is not the point!

The goal that I am setting here for myself is to:
* share the knowledge
* show best practices
* organize my thoughts 
* help others to build better software

I have some initial idea on how I would like things to be presented, here. 
However, there is quite long road ahead to get there that is why a lot of the content 
will be changed, updated or even rearranged on the way.
I hope that this will not frustrate You... if it does, please, let me know by emailing me.

Enjoy!
